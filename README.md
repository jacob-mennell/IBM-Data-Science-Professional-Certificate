# Gym-Venues-New-York-Toronto

###  Repository for work undertaken for the IBM Data Science Professiional Certificate

##### Final capstone project analyses the distribution of gym related venues in Toronto and New York with Python and K-Means Clustering machine learning.

#### API
Foursquare API for Geographic Data on New York and Toronto Venues. 

#### Modules: 
Pandas, GeoPy, Beautiful Soup, Folium. Matplotlib, and scikit-learn (K-Means Clustering).

#### Project Background
The project involves the analysis of boroughs and then neighbourhoods within New York and Toronto. A personal trainer is interested in relocating to increase their client base. The trainer is interested in which area may have the greatest potential customers. It is likely the area with the most gyms or related venues represents an area with significant potential customer volume. A comparison of mean occurrence of gym venues, relative to other venues, within the two cities will indicate which city, and specifically which neighbourhood, maximum customers are likely to occur.

#### Audience
The investigation is beneficial for personal trainers who are flexible regarding the location in which they operate. It is also useful to anyone interested in the spatial distribution of venues relating to gyms. This could be gym users, city planners, local councils, or current and future fitness centre owners.

#### Data
Foursquare API sourced location data highlights venues, specifically gyms and related venues, within each borough, for New York and Toronto. 
Borough with the highest mean occurrence of gym related venues for both cities then compared. 
K means clustering utilised to indicate the distribution of gym venues within neighbourhoods. 
Within the boroughs that hosts the highest mean occurrence of gym venues, the neighbourhoods within them with the greatest mean occurrence of gym related venues will be selected as the proposed area for relocation.
